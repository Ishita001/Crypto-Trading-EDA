# Crypto-Trading-EDA
The Crypto market, as we know, is a market full of
various kinds of investors and influencers. We all very well know
the pizza incident in 2010 where a guy purchased two pizzas at
10000 BTC, which ranges nearly around 80 million in current
times. This clearly describes how much the market has progressed
in these 10-12 years. You can see drastic changes in the price of
several coins in the past few years, which brings in many new
investors to invest their money in this market. Crypto Market
has highly volatile currencies. Bitcoin itself was around 5K INR
in 2013, and by the year 2021, it reached 48 Lakhs INR, which
shows how volatile the market is. The dataset provides some
interesting and valuable insights that help us gather practical
knowledge. As data scientists, we are very keen to understand
such a market whose data is not stable and keeps on changing
frequently and making out new patterns with changing time.
This introduction of new patterns with time makes this problem
itself an interesting one and keeps on motivating us to find some
valuable information.


So, through this manuscript, we are trying to analyze a
specific crypto coin for a particular period. We will find several
interesting patterns in the dataset and explore the historical
return using several statistical models. We will plot the opening
and closing prices of the particular coin by using NumPy, SciPy,
and Matplotlib. We will also try to make predictions of the
cost of the specific currency and then plot the predicted price
line with the actual price line and understand the difference in
the prediction model with the fundamental price mode. We will
use several Data Preprocessing, Data Exploration, Data Mining,
Statistical Analysis, and Data Visualization techniques. We will
also try plotting a particular coin’s year-wise volume and price
fluctuations. Last but not least, we will try comparing two of the
most popular trending cryptocurrencies using a linear regression
model.
